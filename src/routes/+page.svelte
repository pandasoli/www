			Hi, Iâ€™m Eli Soli, a Brazilian systems programmer with a passion for
			writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code rooted in the UNIX and
			POSIX philosophies. I mostly work close to the metal using C and assembly,
			avoiding unnecessary complexity and modern C++ bloat, favoring simplicity
			and performance. Although I occasionally work on fullstack web development
			and have studied it extensively, my main focus and enthusiasm lie in
			low-level programming and crafting software that respects minimalism and
			clarity.
